## Overview
### Description
Workout University is an app that lets you scroll through different types of workouts and lets you build your own workouts. By educating you on the different types of workouts you can do, you are able to build your own routines and go through them at the gym. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

- Category:
    - Health and Fitness
- Mobile:
    - Lets you access workouts and your routines without wifi. People are in the gym with their phones and an app will work better than a website in this situation. 
- Story:
    - Gym lovers will love to use it to track and go through their routines so they don't have to remember what to do. Also, new gym members will love the access to hundreds of exercises to scroll through and make their own routine with. 
- Market:
    - While most gym apps exist, some are complicated and not clear on what value they provide. This app will be simplistic as you mainly scroll through different exercises and pick the ones that interest you into a routine. 
- Habit:
    - The user will open the app whenever they are in the gym to follow their routine. They will also open the app when they are free to build workout routines. 
- Scope:
    - A bulk of the app can be built using API calls and navigation bars.
