## Overview
### Description
Strength University is an app that lets you scroll through different types of workouts and lets you build your own workouts. By educating you on the different types of workouts you can do, you are able to build your own routines and go through them at the gym. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

- Category:
    - Health and Fitness
- Mobile:
    - Lets you access workouts and your routines without wifi. People are in the gym with their phones and an app will work better then a website. 
- Story:
    - Gym lovers will love to use it to track and go through there routines so they don't have to remember what to do. Also new gym members will love the access to hundreds of exercises to scroll through and make there own routine with. 
- Market:
    - While most gym apps exist, some are complicated and not clear in what value they provide. This app will be simplistic as you mainly scroll through different exercises and pick the ones that interest you into a routine. 
- Habit:
    - The user will open the app every time they are in the gym to follow their routine. They will also open the app when they are free to build workouts routines. 
- Scope:
    - This app will be technically challenging as it involves concepts from all the 7 weeks codepath had taught me. But even a striped-down version is useful.
